    <p><em>The Women’s Print History Project, 1750-1830</em> is a comprehensive bibliographical database of women’s contributions to print for one of the most convulsive periods in both women’s and print history. We collect detailed information about books that women were involved in producing, not just as authors, but also as printers, publishers, booksellers, editors, compilers, translators, engravers, illustrators, and composers. In addition to detailed bibliographical information about the material components of the book, we record basic data about the people and firms that produced them, allowing us to trace the networks and relationships that structured the book trades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  In 1806 appeared A New System of Domestic Cookery, formed upon principles of economy, and adapted to the uses of private familes, signed "by a lady," written by Maria Eliza Rundell (1745–1828), and published with the fashionable West End publisher, John Murray II. Domestic Cookery would go on to become the best-selling cookbook of the nineteenth century, with the 68th edition appearing in 1845.
